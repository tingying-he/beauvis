I strongly believe aesthetics is much more than ""looks nice"", and feel that ""how it looks"" cannot be separated from ""what it does"". I like Ge Wang's description of aesthetics from his book Artful Design:

""Aesthetics is how we experience a thing â€”how it emotionally, intellectually, psychologically, and socially affects us. It is everything beyond the thing's function. Yet aesthetics does not usurp or live apart from functionality; instead, it gives context, meaning, and essence to a thing, making it what it is.

In the kitchen of design, aesthetics is not the spice with which you garnish the casserole of functionality: it is the casserole, the ingredients you bake into it.""",,735.77,16.68,,25.6,,,693.49,,,,,
