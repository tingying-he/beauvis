These notions of preference and harmony are often conflated in the literature. This confusion arises, at least in part, because on average people have general preference for harmony (shown for color, shape, and music). Yet, there are clear differences in preference and harmony at the average level (at least for color), and individuals vary widely in the degree to which they aesthetically prefer harmony.  I bring up this issue because a compressive measure of aesthetics would need to be specific about what constructs are being measured, and avoid conflating distinct constructs.

While it is clear in my mind that presence of these characteristics would undermine aesthetic pleasure, they do nevertheless correlate (negatively) with it. So wasn't sure whether to relate them as relevant or irrelevant. In the end I rated them as relevant, but there is a risk that you may get mixed interpretations of what is required here rather than necessarily mixed views on whether they are relevant.

I have also followed your requirement to judge ""aesthetic pleasure"" which I strongly believe to be different to ""aesthetic"", which might include other designs that provoke a feeling of some type. For example Hashimito's 'Every Nuclear Explosion' has a very strong aesthetic appeal but is not 'pleasurable'. I think it would be a pity if this work conflates the two.","","885.05","22.42","","19.79","","","842.84","","","",""

You stressed to consider aesthetics only, going through the list I realized again how difficult it is to separate content and presentation.  A visualization can be good, exciting, provoking etc. because of both… I went through the list again, and found that almost terms can be applied here. But I tried to give the more aesthetic terms a higher score.

Related to this, in my lectures I also discuss aesthetics, and tell my students what I learned during courses on graphic design (I studied Industrial Design). The professionals stress one aspect: READABILITY. And, if a piece is readable (well-designed, balanced, good, professional), the aesthetics comes for free.

Furthermore, I always tell the following anecdote. A long time ago, I went to a fancy hifi-shop to buy expensive speakers. The salesperson had a great advice. If you think “what a beautiful speakers!”: don’t buy. If you think “what a beautiful music!: buy!
